# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project — Technology Trends Analysis (2025)

## Overview
This capstone project explores global **technology and developer trends** using real survey data. I analyzed how programming languages, databases, and visualization tools are evolving across industries — helping identify which technologies are shaping the future of analytics and AI.

## Project Methodology
- **Data Collection & Preparation:** Used the `survey_data_updated.csv` dataset. Cleaned and transformed the data using **Excel**, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and splitting multi-value fields.  
- **Dashboard Creation:** Designed three dashboards in **IBM Cognos Analytics** —  
  1️*Current Technology Usage*  
  2️*Future Technology Trends*  
  3️*Demographics Overview*  
- **Insight Generation:** Summarized findings and visualized patterns to understand developer preferences and technology adoption.

## Key Learnings
- Gained **hands-on experience** in the **end-to-end data analytics workflow** — from raw data cleaning to dashboard storytelling.  
- Improved my ability to use **Excel, and IBM Cognos Analytics** to deliver clear, insight-driven visualizations.  
- Learned how to **structure analytical reports** that connect technical data with business insights.  
- Developed strong **data interpretation and presentation** skills — turning survey data into a meaningful story.

## Project Insights
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, and JavaScript dominate usage; Go and TypeScript are gaining traction.  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL and MongoDB are on the rise, while SQL Server remains strong in enterprise systems.  
- **Developers:** Most respondents are aged 18–34 with strong educational backgrounds, driving innovation and cloud adoption.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Excel
- SQL 
- IBM Cognos Analytics  
- Data Visualization & Dashboard Design  

## Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to work with **real-world datasets**, apply **analytical thinking**, and create **interactive dashboards** that support decision-making. It represents the final step of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**, integrating all key skills I learned throughout the course.
